# Clustering and classification

## Part I

Load the packages:

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

library(caret)
library(Rtsne)
```

Read the data:

```{r}
data("Boston")
```

Dataset is quite old, 1978?

Data has:

- 14 numeric variables
- 2 of variables are discrete [chas and rad]
- 12 of variables are continous
- 506 observations


```{r}
dim(Boston)
str(Boston)

sum(sapply(Boston, function(x){is.double(x)})) # number of continous  variables
sum(sapply(Boston, function(x){!is.double(x)})) # number of discrete variables
```

## Part II

Let's see what is our data made of.
Let's go through the variables

##### crim

- per capita crime rate by town
- right skewed distribution
- 70 % of observations are below 2 
- last 10% have values that really stand out of the overall distribution

```{r}
summary(Boston$crim)

quantile(Boston$crim, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.1))

ggplot(Boston, aes(crim)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1,fill="white",colour="black")

```

##### zn

- proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. 
- lots over 25,000 seem to be quite rare because 74 % of areas don't have those

```{r}
summary(Boston$zn)

nrow(Boston[which(Boston$zn == 0),])/nrow(Boston)

ggplot(Boston, aes(zn)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1,fill="white",colour="black")
```

##### indus

- proportion of non-retail business acres per town. 
- histogram seems little bit polarised. Maby the right tail of histogram represents manufacturing areas?

```{r}
summary(Boston$indus)

                   binwidth=1,

        x = "$1000s", 
        y = "Density")
```

##### Correlations

###  Part III

Next I will replace the original dataset with standardized dataset. 

After standardization each variable has zero mean and unit variance. 

Standardization is common workprocedure in data mining. One main reason for this is that some procedures like dimension reduction give more accurate results when all the variables have same scale. 

- LDA which we are going to use later on in this exercise has assumption varibles have same variance

There is:
- nox which had range 0.385 to 0.8710
- zn which had range 0 to 100

After standardization:
- nox has range -1.4644 to 2.7296
- zn has range from -0.48724 to 3.8004


```{r}
Boston <- as.data.frame(
  scale(Boston)
)

summary(Boston)
# sd(Boston$zn)
```

Then i will create new category variable based on crimerate values.
- Values are cut four bins based on the quantiles
- Finally i will replace original continous variable with created category variable

```{r}
breaks <- quantile(Boston$crim, probs = seq(0,1,0.25))

crime <- cut(Boston$crim, 
             breaks = breaks, 
             labels = c("low","med_low","med_high","high"),
             include.lowest = TRUE)

# replace continous variable with category variable
Boston$crim <- crime

```

Finally i will divide dataset to train and test sets. 
- Split will be 80/20. 
- 80 % of observations go to the trainset
- Split is done by means on random sampling

```{r}
# set seed for Reproductivit
set.seed(8520)

# choose randomly 80% of the rows
ind <- sample(nrow(Boston),  size = nrow(Boston) * 0.8)

# create train set
train <- Boston[ind,]

# create test set 
test <- Boston[-ind,]
```

### Part IV

It's time to fit a LDA model. Then i'll print the summary of the model.

One thing that chatches eye is the porpotion of trace: first linear discriminant explains 0.95 of the total variance. 

```{r}
lda.fit <- lda(crim ~ ., data = train)
```

Then i will draw the LDA (bi)plot. I'll skip the arrows, because i think that they distract more than explain

- polarised: high values define distinct groub
- which probaply explains the high percentage of LD1
- division between: low,med_low,med_high depend more on LD2 and LD3 and there aren't clear class boundaries. Maby set doesn't have enough info or LDA or maby task is beyond capablities of linear model..

```{r}
# target classes as numeric
classes <- as.numeric(train$crim)

# plot the lda results
plot(lda.fit,
     col = classes,
     pch = classes,
     dimen = 2)
```

## Part V

Let's see how my model manages with unseen data. 

First I will save the crime categories from the test set and then remove the categorical crime variable from the test dataset.

Then I will predict with the LDA model on the test data.

```{r}
# save crime categories from the test set
categories <- test$crim
# remove variable from test set
test$crim <- NULL
# predict the classes with the LDA model on the test data
pred <- predict(lda.fit, newdata = test)

df = data.frame(obs = categories,
                pred = pred$class)

```

Finally I will analyse results with caret -packages confusionMatrix -function, which will print detailed overview of results.

- Model accuracy is way higher than No Information rate. No information rate is so slow because there isn't any dominant class in test set.
- In the (bi)Plot of the model we noticed that groub High is clearly separated of the rest of classess. That separation can also be seen in the prediction results: sensitivity High is were high.
- And model has difficulities with low, med_low and med_hihg classess, which didn't have disctinct borders in the (bi)plot either.

```{r}
# for starters let's print the distibution of true values
table(categories)

df = data.frame(obs = categories,
                pred = pred$class)

xtab <- table(df$pred, df$obs)

# summary of results
print(confusionMatrix(xtab))
```

## Part VI

- Reload the Boston dataset and standardize the dataset
Calculate the distances between the observations.
Run k-means algorithm on the dataset. 

Investigate what is the optimal number of clusters

and run the algorithm again. 

Visualize the clusters (for example with the pairs() or ggpairs() functions, where the clusters are separated with colors) and interpret the results. (0-4 points)


```{r}
# clear memory und reload data
rm(list=ls())
data("Boston")

# backup copy of original data
bak <- Boston

# standardize the dataset"
Boston <- as.data.frame(scale(Boston))
```

##### Distance of observations

Let's calculate the distance matrix of observations

```{r}
# calculate the euclidean distance of observations
dist_Boston = as.matrix(dist(Boston, 
                             method = "euclidean"))
```

As a sanity check lets print:

- the most similar observations
- observations that have least common

And according prints distance matrix seems to be ok.

```{r}
copy_of_dist <- dist_Boston

# clear diagonal axis and lower triangle, so that:
# - we have unique distances
# - don't have observations distance with itself, which is always 0
diag(copy_of_dist) <- NA
dist_Boston[lower.tri(copy_of_dist)] <- NA


# - most similar pair
bak[which(copy_of_dist==min(copy_of_dist, na.rm = TRUE), arr.ind = TRUE)[1, ], ]

# - most dissimilar pair
bak[which(copy_of_dist==max(copy_of_dist, na.rm = TRUE), arr.ind = TRUE)[1, ], ]

rm(copy_of_dist)
```

##### K-Means clustering

First i will select the optimal number of clusters.

I'll use so called <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/finding-optimal-number-of-clusters/">elbow method</a> where one:

- tries different cluster counts and records each time variance explained as a function of the number of clusters
- plots findings
- looks where the gain starts to slow down

So instead of seeking smallest value we are interested in where the trend chances.

Based on the plot, two seems to be optimal number of clusters.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
k_max <- 10

# calculate the total within sum of squares
twcss <- sapply(1:k_max, function(k){kmeans(Boston, k)$tot.withinss})

df <- data.frame(val = twcss,
                 n = 1:length(twcss))

ggplot(df, aes(y = val, x = factor(n), group = 1)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Number of clusters", 
       y = "Total within sum of squares")
  


```

No that the number of clusters is fixed. I'll run the clustering once again.

Visualize the clusters (for example with the pairs() or ggpairs() functions, where the clusters are separated with colors) and interpret the results.

```{r}
Boston$clust <- kmeans(Boston, 2)$cluster
```

```{r}
breaks <- quantile(Boston$crim, probs = seq(0,1,0.25))

crime <- cut(Boston$crim, 
             breaks = breaks, 
             labels = c("low","med_low","med_high","high"),
             include.lowest = TRUE)

# replace continous variable with category variable
Boston$crim <- crime
```



VIZ

```{r}
sne_obj <- Rtsne(dist_Boston, is_distance = TRUE)

tsne_data <- sne_obj$Y %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  setNames(c("X", "Y")) %>%
  mutate(cluster = Boston$clust) %>%
  mutate(crime = Boston$crim)


ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y), data = tsne_data) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cluster, size=crime))

library(ggalt)

midwest_select <- tsne_data[tsne_data$cluster == 2,]

ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y), data = tsne_data) +
  geom_point(aes(color = crime)) +
  geom_encircle(aes(x = X, y = Y), 
                data = midwest_select,
                color="red", 
                size=1, 
                expand=0.02)

```
